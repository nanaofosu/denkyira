<h1>RECONSIDERED </h1>
<h2>SPECIAL FOCUS: SISTERS ON STAFF</h2>
<p>Doug and Vicki Jacoby, Washington DC</p>
<p>Spring 2002</p>
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Three papers</p>
<p>In 1990 I authored a paper along with Pat Gempel, “What Does the Bible Really Say about Women?” This first</p>
<p>paper was written primarily with a non-Christian readership in mind. In 1993 “The Women's Role & Current</p>
<p>Practice” appeared, later presented to the worldwide leadership of the International Churches of Christ in Los</p>
<p>Angeles (August, 1993). This second paper was written in part as a justification for expanding the women’s role</p>
<p>in the church beyond nominal service (e.g. making Communion bread). As a result, women began to baptize,</p>
<p>usher, and share publicly with confidence that the scriptures did not forbid their doing so.1 At this time I am</p>
<p>joined by my wife in revisiting the women’s role—not to retract what has been written, but to reconsider our</p>
<p>practice vis-à-vis women in a third paper.</p>
<p>Biblical approach</p>
<p>In our common approach to women’s ministry, we have for all intents and purposes declared that we will “speak</p>
<p>where the Bible is silent.” Admittedly, opinion matters and flexibility are proper in areas where the Scriptures</p>
<p>do not direct us. For example, the Bible never explains which verses women should study with other women to</p>
<p>influence them to become Christians. But what about the things the Bible does teach? There are scores (perhaps</p>
<p>hundreds) of verses laying out the divine plan for marriage and family. Have we been selective? Have we</p>
<p>obeyed those passages where the Bible does speak?</p>
<p>Thesis</p>
<p>Simply put, our conclusion is that ICOC teaching on women’s ministry does not flow from the Scriptures, but</p>
<p>rather receives its inspiration from the American corporate model. Whereas the scriptures insist on the unity of</p>
<p>marriage and family, the spiritual nurture of children, genuine hospitality, and the husband’s loving protection</p>
<p>of his wife, we have paid insufficient attention to such passages. Instead, we have been caught up in the vortex</p>
<p>of achievement.2 We are very competitive. We compete against others, against ourselves, in some cases even</p>
<p>against our own spouses. We compete against previous records, always striving to maximize growth. In terms of</p>
<p>growth, however, we have been slowing down for years. The church is a dysfunctional family to the extent that</p>
<p>we attempt to build it by the world’s rules.</p>
<p>Our women—and our families—are paying the price.3 Vicki and I have talked extensively. Her ideas and</p>
<p>perspectives have been extremely helpful—hence this paper, which we have produced together. “The Women’s</p>
<p>Role Reconsidered” does explore the women’s role generally, yet its special emphasis is on the lifestyle and role</p>
<p>of sisters on staff.</p>
<p>II. OUR CORPORATE CULTURE</p>
<p>1 For the record, we still hold to the position that women are not to exercise authority over men in the assembly.</p>
<p>2 Loosely speaking, we are part of the “church growth movement,” most prominent in the United States. While</p>
<p>growth must be our passion and our aim, this does not mean it is to be our primary goal. The scriptures teach that growth</p>
<p>comes naturally when we faithfully hold to the scriptures. And yet it can no more be forced than we can “force” our</p>
<p>children to grow taller, or crops to grow. Acts 2:47 is a by-product of Acts 2:42.</p>
<p>3 When I shared our conviction with the ICOC Teachers at the KT Conferences in 2001 and 2002, all agreed this is</p>
<p>a huge need in the movement. They urged me not to drop the matter.</p>
<p>Disintegration vs. integration</p>
<p>In Genesis 1-2 the Lord makes clear that the woman’s place is alongside the man. In friendship, in walking with</p>
<p>God, and in conjugal love, the woman is in every way man’s equal and his true partner. Yet does this mean the</p>
<p>woman must strive for a role equal to the man’s? Of course not. In leadership, physical strength, emotional</p>
<p>stamina, and above all within the marriage relationship, man is “the stronger vessel”4 (1 Peter 3). This fact is</p>
<p>generally overlooked in the American corporate view of woman, where woman is pressed to achieve what men</p>
<p>achieve—or at least try to.</p>
<p>A few years back in the Washingtonian there appeared an article in which it was proposed that having children</p>
<p>was a sure way to slow down one’s career and detract from self-fulfillment. We should forego having children,</p>
<p>if we really want the most out of life. Kids are, it was implied, a total nuisance. We were not the only ones</p>
<p>disturbed by the article and finding it in bad taste, and (Doug) decided to phone one of the editors and have a</p>
<p>chat. She told me that many had been upset by the feature, which had actually been intended “as a provocative</p>
<p>joke.” Yet if this was so obviously a joke, why did so many persons take it seriously? Surely because it strikes</p>
<p>so close to home. It is endemic in our culture to sacrifice family for career achievement.5 And so family</p>
<p>disintegrates. And not just in the world; it is happening before our very eyes in our own movement. A far cry</p>
<p>from the original plan of God, which entails happy marriages, spiritual children, and striving together for</p>
<p>common goals as a family.</p>
<p>Put simply, corporate culture disintegrates the family; biblical culture integrates it. Our movement is already</p>
<p>experiencing an alarmingly high level of disintegration. The source: the world. The model: corporate America.</p>
<p>The solution: rethinking everything—questioning “the system” and plunging into the Word of God.</p>
<p>Dueling incomes</p>
<p>We all have seen the stats on percentages of “working women” in the United States. When we were growing up</p>
<p>in the ’60s, the overwhelming majority of married women carried on the noble work of homemaking and</p>
<p>childrearing, while her husband provided for the family financially. Women did not feel too much pressure to</p>
<p>“make something of themselves”—even those with college degrees.</p>
<p>My (Doug’s) own mother, for example, worked as a journalist until she married my father. Not until the nest</p>
<p>was nearly empty did she resume work—after some 20 years of homemaking. (My brother and I are glad she</p>
<p>took the time off.)</p>
<p>Though I (Vicki) was brought up in a slightly different culture (England), I too am grateful that my mother</p>
<p>stopped working as a nurse during the years she and my father were bringing up my sisters and me. There were</p>
<p>some financial hard times, which forced mum back to part-time work. The strain of holding down “two” jobs</p>
<p>was considerable. As a result she contracted rheumatic fever.</p>
<p>And yet things changed through the turbulent ’60s and ’70s—the Sexual Revolution, the Feminist Movement,</p>
<p>and the anti-establishment, anti-authoritarian streak left our world forever changed. Despite the positive</p>
<p>contributions of the feminist movement, it was largely responsible for the change. No longer was it worthy of a</p>
<p>woman to just “stay at home.” “Not working” was a stigma, and motherhood gradually came to be viewed as a</p>
<p>lesser calling than a professional vocation.</p>
<p>Today the vast majority of wives work outside the home.6 Children are regularly farmed out to daycare centers</p>
<p>and other providers, but why? Many mothers may feel more fulfilled having careers as doctors, lawyers, and</p>
<p>business executives. Mothers in two-income families may claim they cannot “survive” with only one income.</p>
<p>4 Yes, in some marriages the woman may have the stronger character; we are speaking generally.</p>
<p>5 A survey of well paid academics and businesswomen recently revealed that 42% of them were still childless at</p>
<p>age 40-55. “While top male executives tend to have spouses and babies (sometimes several of each), top women bosses</p>
<p>often have neither” (“High fliers and motherhood” in The Economist [May 11th 2002], 78).</p>
<p>6 Despite a countermovement either to work from the home or “be a stay-at-home mom.”</p>
<p>Perhaps more significant, they are under pressure from their husbands to work. This is not just a matter of</p>
<p>keeping up with the Joneses; servicing the considerable debt (mortgages, various loans, and above all, monthly</p>
<p>credit card payments) has created a sort of bondage which cripples family life and leaves couples with no choice</p>
<p>but to bring in two incomes.</p>
<p>Yet is the extra income really necessary? The typical American home in the ’00s is more than double the floor</p>
<p>space of the typical home in the ’50s or ’60s (when most of you reading this article were growing up). The fact</p>
<p>is, much of the marginal increase from dual incomes is eaten up in higher taxes, daycare costs, and other</p>
<p>expenses incurred as a result of the fatigue the working mother suffers trying to cope with day-to-day life.7</p>
<p>Despite all these negative effects, we as a movement have bought right into this thinking.8</p>
<p>In our society at large, sadly, America (though never technically Christian) has departed significantly from a</p>
<p>more biblical model. The dual income model has both catalyzed this change and been accelerated by it. So what</p>
<p>are the fruits of our society’s more “enlightened” approach to the institutions of work and family?</p>
<p>Dire straits</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the negative effects when the biblical order is violated. (We are focusing on the situation</p>
<p>of the sisters, although we realize much more could be said about families.)</p>
<p> Many of our women in poor health. Generally speaking, the greater the leadership pressure, the more</p>
<p>prevalent the illness. We don’t believe all of this is coincidental. Take a look at our sisters’ health at the</p>
<p>WSL, GSL, and WML levels. Unhealthy pressure levels have psychosomatic effects.</p>
<p> Kids are relegated and delegated to secondary caregivers. They may become resentful and they often</p>
<p>become worldly. Just as our members (leaders included) feel used when we are overly focused on</p>
<p>results, so our kids can feel like objects. “Quantity time” (essential to effective parenting) degenerates to</p>
<p>“quality time” (the tacit admission that other things are more important).</p>
<p> Marriages are dysfunctional. (Think for a moment just how much time and money have been spent to</p>
<p>rehabilitate the marriages of many of our main leaders!)</p>
<p>7 Let me here recommend Robert Wuthnow’s penetrating sociological study, Poor Richard’s Principle, which I</p>
<p>have said elsewhere ought to be required reading for all ministers. Wuthnow’s exposé of corporate America’s chokehold on</p>
<p>us all (debt, companies’ supposedly beneficial perquisites, etc) is masterful.</p>
<p>8 Consider, for example:</p>
<p> Job descriptions patterned after the business world (though without the performance evaluations).</p>
<p> Corporate hierarchy. (Parallels military officers v. enlisted men, or denominational clergy v. laity.) Though helpful,</p>
<p>hierarchy becomes negative when appreciation and respect become inflated. We are not to lord it over others, nor</p>
<p>are we to be treated with adulation.</p>
<p> Salary structures patterned after the business world.</p>
<p> Insistence that our women be paid, in part so that they would have credibility with career women in the world.</p>
<p> Artificial distinction (compartmentalization) between “ministry” (business) and everything else.</p>
<p> Extensive business travel (and time away from our kids).</p>
<p> Emphasis on making church services marketable (“relatable”): dynamism, “entertainment ministry,” etc.</p>
<p> Honorific titles (Matthew 23:9), which tend to exacerbate a clergy/laity distinction. Furthermore, we are not to</p>
<p>derive our self-esteem from our title, but from our relationship with God (Luke 10:20 etc).</p>
<p> Expectations that the “higher-ups” should be served. Jesus’ ministry style was to serve others (Mark 10:45). To</p>
<p>minister actually means “to serve” (in Greek as well as in Latin).</p>
<p> “Executive assistants.” It is hard to imitate a lifestyle propped up by extra personnel.</p>
<p> Considerable discretionary spending funds, typical of CEOs and other corporate officers. (This is an area in which</p>
<p>we can get into trouble.)</p>
<p> The near celebrity status of many of our “CEOs”—and their children—in the fellowship.</p>
<p> Elevation of worldly credentials over spiritual (heart level) requirements.</p>
<p> A near obsession with “sharpness,” polish and image.</p>
<p> Our spending habits and upper-middle class standards of living.</p>
<p> Heavy reliance on statistical analysis and monthly goals.</p>
<p>Not that all of these things are all bad. Suffice it to say, most of the trappings of corporate America have their parallels in</p>
<p>the church.</p>
<p> We are losing our kids. If women (and men) were more invested in their own kids, surely the attrition</p>
<p>rate among our second generation—already frightfully high—would be reduced.</p>
<p> Women often baptize more than men, which leads to an inequality in the female-male ratio, especially</p>
<p>in the first world churches.9 This may well be a direct consequence of taking the women away from</p>
<p>their God-given duties and asking them to devote more time and energy to ministry outside the home.</p>
<p>Yes, they can baptize their friends and neighbors—and rightfully so; but what about the second</p>
<p>generation?10</p>
<p> Persistent, nagging guilt—for not taking care of those they love most (husband and children).</p>
<p> Depression, medication, therapy… our systemic dysfunction manifests itself in so many ways.</p>
<p>Recently I (Doug) had lunch with a denominational minister, who put a direct question to me. “How are the</p>
<p>marriages and families of your top leaders doing?” Sadly, I had to confess that we were having some struggles,</p>
<p>and were in the midst of rethinking many things. (I hated to admit this, but it’s the truth.)</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The disintegrating effects of corporate American culture are being felt deeply throughout the ICOC. As a result,</p>
<p>we are now in dire straits. It is now time to examine our teaching on the women’s role, to see if/how it has been</p>
<p>affected by the culture of the world</p>
<p>III. EXPERIMENTS WITH THE WOMAN’S ROLE</p>
<p>Assuaging the pressure</p>
<p>Churches worldwide are already wrestling with these issues. In some churches, although paid by the church as</p>
<p>WMLs, the many sisters are “pulling back” and spending more time with family than they had in the past. In</p>
<p>quite a few places, mothers attend midweeks only every other week. In some congregations, the kids do not</p>
<p>come to midweeks—for reasons concerning homework and sleep, primarily). Mounting efforts (worldwide) to</p>
<p>tweak the system in order to afford more grace to parents are proof that we are aware of the pressures on our</p>
<p>families.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are many ongoing discussions about the women’s role—just as there are about the failure of the</p>
<p>family in the movement. So many of our children are not doing well, and we are the ones who are responsible.</p>
<p>Have we created a system unfriendly to family? To a significant extent, we believe the answer is yes.</p>
<p>“Women’s Ministry”?</p>
<p>In Titus 2 Paul commands that the older women teach the younger women. In leadership classes in Boston in the</p>
<p>early ’80s, this well known passage was construed as the biblical basis for a separate women’s ministry. It was</p>
<p>important at that time to support our sisters in their God-given roles as fellow disciples of Christ, as well as to</p>
<p>protect the brothers from compromising situations in which they might work too closely with them. We meant</p>
<p>well, but did we “rightly divide” the passage? Did we read too much into the text?11</p>
<p>We have held that, based on Titus 2, women should head up the women’s ministry. Now whether this is true or</p>
<p>not, such a conclusion hardly flows from Paul’s instructions to Titus! What is actually written? The older</p>
<p>9 In Third World churches, the situation is not infrequently the opposite: the brothers outnumber the sisters. And</p>
<p>yet the women leaders often have domestic servants. Could it be that most women in a Third World context cannot relate to</p>
<p>such an upper class lifestyle?</p>
<p>10 Since women tend to be more spiritual than men anyway, perhaps less time is needed for them to lead others to</p>
<p>Christ than for men to do the same.</p>
<p>11 Once again, for fear of being misunderstood, I am not reneging on my view of women’s ministry insofar as</p>
<p>women may teach women, baptize, usher, and so forth. In fact, in the position paper I stressed that we err when we say—as</p>
<p>we still often do say—“this man and his wife lead the church.” That is because, in my view at that time as now, it is the</p>
<p>man who leads the church. She supports him. The church is not composed of two congregations: a church of males and a</p>
<p>church of females!</p>
<p>women (those who are farther along in life—married, having raised their kids, and living spiritually exemplary</p>
<p>lives) are to train up the younger women.12 Train them in the women’s ministry? No, train them to love their</p>
<p>husbands, to bring up children, to be busy at home, and so forth.</p>
<p>We have taught that the women (ironically, usually the younger women!) are to master principles of leadership,</p>
<p>evangelism, ministerial organization—everything, in effect, we expect the men to do—and then impart these</p>
<p>principles to the other women.</p>
<p>1 You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine. 2 Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of</p>
<p>respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance. 3 Likewise, teach the older women to</p>
<p>be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. 4</p>
<p>Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children, 5 to be self-controlled and</p>
<p>pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the</p>
<p>word of God. (Titus 2:1-5)</p>
<p>Paul classifies his commands regarding domestic matters to be a matter of “sound doctrine.” There are quite</p>
<p>specific instructions for older men, older women, and younger women. (The passage continues to cover the</p>
<p>younger men and slaves.) Let’s now compare Paul’s instruction to our instruction:</p>
<p>Titus 2 Our take</p>
<p>ڤ Older women teach younger women. ڤ Spiritually older women (often physically</p>
<p>younger) teach the older women.</p>
<p>ڤ They teach the nuts and bolts of ڤ They teach the nuts and bolts of everything—</p>
<p>marriage and motherhood. but primarily of “moving the ministry.”</p>
<p>ڤ They are to be “busy at home.” ڤ They are to be “busy in their (out-of-the-home)</p>
<p>ministry.</p>
<p>We’ve spiritualized the passage—to our own detriment. The level of pressure to achieve, to make one’s mark, to</p>
<p>be a woman who can compete with a man, is enormous. Negative effects often come from pressure to reach</p>
<p>monthly growth goals.13 Pressure is good, but the wrong kind of pressure leads to breaches of integrity, shoddy</p>
<p>workmanship, and familial dysfunction.</p>
<p>When we were younger as a movement, motherhood was not a major issue and our career-woman interpretation</p>
<p>of the scriptures was easy to uphold (though less and less so through the 1980s). But now we are older, and the</p>
<p>old approaches are failing us. Let me take one example: discipling partners.</p>
<p>Children as “discipling partners”</p>
<p>In the old days (pre-parenthood), a single or married-without-kids could easily disciple three persons. This was</p>
<p>usually defined as having three separate appointments a week, one per person. (We all know the routine!) Then</p>
<p>along came kids and we began to struggle a bit; we had to rethink our priorities. We never heard anyone ask,</p>
<p>how many d-partners would you have to acquire before you had the functional equivalent of one child? This</p>
<p>may sound like a strange question, but it is integral to this discussion. How much time does one child take?</p>
<p>Even if your husband took half of the “strain”—which seems unlikely in most homes!—wouldn’t it be fair to</p>
<p>consider your share of child rearing as more time-consuming than having two d-partners? (Actually, it’s crazy to</p>
<p>talk like this, because we all now it is far, far more demanding. But we hope our conservative assumptions will</p>
<p>be accepted.) If so, three kids plus three d-partners would actually be the equivalent of nine d-partners. Yes,</p>
<p>12 The passage also teaches that the men are to teach the older women. To what extend does this take place in our</p>
<p>movement?</p>
<p>13 Due to the sensitive nature of my paper on Statistics and Church Growth, it is available to staff members only.</p>
<p>nine! Compared to the sister without children who is discipling three women, you would be carrying triple the</p>
<p>load.</p>
<p>At some point this all has to be processed. All too often we hear evangelists—consciously or not—minimizing</p>
<p>mothers’ God-given responsibilities, sometimes even verging on denigrating motherhood (and children) as</p>
<p>something that, if we are not careful, might “slow down the ministry.”14 But motherhood and fatherhood is our</p>
<p>ministry! How can we evangelize the world if we cannot “evangelize” the second generation?</p>
<p>Careerism, and the American corporate view of the woman’s role, must be resisted. It must be refuted biblically.</p>
<p>The world has deeply, deeply affected our movement for the worse.</p>
<p>IV. WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</p>
<p>Women’s role in the N.T.</p>
<p>What is the women’s role as seen in the N.T.? Let’s focus first on the book of Acts. A brief glance at the</p>
<p>women’s role in that book reveals the following. (Numbers in parentheses are chapter numbers.)</p>
<p> Women prayed (1, 12, 16).</p>
<p> At Pentecost, women prophesied when the Spirit was poured out (2).</p>
<p> Women took responsibility, with their husbands, for personal financial decisions (5).</p>
<p> Women were imprisoned (8, 22).</p>
<p> Women ministered to the needy (9).</p>
<p> Women made their homes available for evangelism and church services (16).</p>
<p> Prominent women were converted (16, 17).</p>
<p> Women were occasionally involved with their husbands in church planting (18).</p>
<p> Not all women were married (21). The majority, however, became wives and mothers.</p>
<p>Other books of the N.T. also shed light on the discussion.</p>
<p> Some financially floated Jesus’ ministry (Luke 8).</p>
<p> They arranged hospitality (John 11).15</p>
<p> They were hard working (Romans 16).</p>
<p> They spoke (albeit in a limited way) in church meetings (1 Corinthians 11, 14).</p>
<p> They were to be submissive to their husbands (Ephesians 5).</p>
<p> They were fellow workers in the gospel with male leaders (Philippians 4).</p>
<p> They were honored, not denigrated, for child-bearing and child-rearing (1 Timothy 2-3, 5; Titus 2).</p>
<p> They were expected to be excellent mothers and homemakers (the Pastorals).</p>
<p> They were live patiently and spiritually as they trusted the Lord to bring their non-Christian spouses to a</p>
<p>knowledge of the truth (1 Peter 3).</p>
<p>Moreover, the main responsibility for educating the children at the primary level has traditionally fallen upon</p>
<p>the woman. For example, Proverbs frequently urges children to heed not only the wise words of their fathers but</p>
<p>also the instruction of their mothers. Is it best for babysitter or other caregiver to assume the lion’s share of</p>
<p>childrearing during the “critical years” (0-5)? Certainly, the scriptures do not disallow babysitters. Yet the</p>
<p>crucial roles of Mother and Father are repeatedly highlighted.</p>
<p>14 Echoes of the false teaching of the Gnostics of the first and second centuries? (1 Timothy 4:1-5 etc.)</p>
<p>15 Often, when staff women have others over to their homes, they do not personally prepare the meal and arrange</p>
<p>the other details of hospitality. Rather, they may rely on caterers, take-away restaurants, or even those who have been</p>
<p>invited—and asked to “bring something” with them. This seems quite different to the biblical hospitality we read about in</p>
<p>both testaments.</p>
<p>In short, the Word shows us that women were spiritual. They were effective in their ministries—yet without</p>
<p>functioning as WMLs (in the ICOC sense). They were expected to be every bit as committed as the men (Luke</p>
<p>9:23), yet their primary ministry was in the home.16</p>
<p>Women and Career in the Bible</p>
<p>“The Wife of Noble Character” is the crowning jewel in the collection of wisdom in God’s Word, which is the</p>
<p>Book of Proverbs.</p>
<p>10 A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.</p>
<p>11 Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.</p>
<p>12 She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.</p>
<p>13 She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.</p>
<p>14 She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.</p>
<p>15 She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls.</p>
<p>16 She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.</p>
<p>17 She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks.</p>
<p>18 She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night.</p>
<p>19 In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.</p>
<p>20 She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy.</p>
<p>21 When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet.</p>
<p>22 She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.</p>
<p>23 Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.</p>
<p>24 She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.</p>
<p>25 She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.</p>
<p>26 She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.</p>
<p>27 She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</p>
<p>28 Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</p>
<p>29 "Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all."</p>
<p>30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</p>
<p>31 Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.</p>
<p>Proverbs 31 is the perfect antidote to careerism (the worldly response to insecurity, the feminist movement, and</p>
<p>selfishness). What do we see in the famous eulogy of the ideal woman?</p>
<p> She takes care of her children. (This is not delegated to others.)</p>
<p> She is hard working and industrious.</p>
<p> She enjoys a measure of financial independence, and her husband trusts her with the checkbook.</p>
<p> She conducts a “side business,” though from within the home.</p>
<p> Her home is exemplary, and brings her husband credit and honor in the public arena.</p>
<p> Just as her husband provides for her, so she too provides for him, and brings him credit.</p>
<p> There is a positive dynamic between her and her husband.</p>
<p> She is able to pass on what she has learned to others, through “faithful instruction.”</p>
<p> In short, she excels in “domestic” qualities.</p>
<p>In connection with this well known passage, consider the flipside—or what we call “the Proverbs 31 man.”</p>
<p>(This is actually a short lesson we like to present when we lead marriage seminars.) Read through the passage</p>
<p>again, with an eye on the man behind the woman:</p>
<p> He has full confidence in his wife.</p>
<p> He trusts her with domestic responsibilities.</p>
<p> He is gainfully employed and highly respected outside the house.</p>
<p>16 These words are hard to stomach for some. We have embraced a non-biblical definition of ministry. Ask most</p>
<p>ICOC members what “ministry” means, and they will mention the “full-time ministry” (another misnomer), being on staff,</p>
<p>aiming to “grow” a group through evangelism. Yet the New Testament defines ministry as the sphere in which we serve</p>
<p>others. Although evangelism is normative for all churches and church members in the N.T., other ministries are emphasized</p>
<p>equally, if not more. For more on this, see Shining Like Stars: The Evangelism Handbook for the New Millennium (DPI,</p>
<p>2000), chapter 7.</p>
<p> He allows her to have a modicum of financial independence.</p>
<p> He does not “control” her, but allows her to live her own life.</p>
<p> He is positive about his wife, and says positive things about her.</p>
<p> His children perceive their mother in a highly positive light. Certainly this is affected by their father’s</p>
<p>disposition.</p>
<p> He is not focused on the outward (her appearance and charm), but on her character (her fear of God).</p>
<p> Bottom line, he respects his wife.</p>
<p>In Proverbs 31, the “ideal wife” leads a fulfilling life even without a career outside the home. Though her life</p>
<p>does not exclude “business,” the primary locus of her ministry is the home.</p>
<p>Another passage not to be overlooked is 1 Timothy 5, which contains the requirements for being placed on the</p>
<p>list of widows—that is, those older women who will be receiving support from the church. The order of widows</p>
<p>would be, in our approach to ministry, a quasi-staff position. (The widow needs to have lived a productive life,</p>
<p>and this qualification is certainly expected to continue once she receives financial assistance from the</p>
<p>congregation.) Well, what do we see, and what do we not see?</p>
<p> She has distinguished herself in bringing up faithful children.</p>
<p> She has been excellent in the area of hospitality.</p>
<p> She has “helped those who are in trouble”—a qualification involving the heart (mercy) and the head</p>
<p>(practical assistance).</p>
<p> She has devoted herself to a variety of good deeds, though none is specified.17</p>
<p> Note: Nothing is said about evangelism or leadership level.18</p>
<p>Those things we have most emphasized are virtually absent from the biblical record, and vice versa. We have</p>
<p>wandered from the biblical message.</p>
<p>Women and family</p>
<p>What are our staff sisters currently being expected to do? (Please excuse a little exaggeration for effect,</p>
<p>realizing that not all ministries emphasize all the following responsibilities.) Our mothers-in-the-ministry are</p>
<p>expected not just to live up to the domestic qualifications of the Bible—which itself is no mean feat—but also to</p>
<p>have consistent Quiet Times, individual weekly discipling times with those they disciple, attend all “meetings of</p>
<p>the body,” be involved in studies, counseling, and leadership sessions. They are expected to travel to</p>
<p>conferences (and arrange all the babysitting and transportation required in their absence), return phone calls, and</p>
<p>be reasonably acquainted with e-mail and the basics of administration. There are social obligations revolving</p>
<p>around the kids: school functions, sports activities, lessons, practices, and helping kids with their homework.</p>
<p>And amidst the chaos of life and leadership, they must also keep their weight down and fitness up, and keep a</p>
<p>positive disposition.</p>
<p>Contrary to the preliminary hopes of non-mothers and mothers of very young children, it only gets more</p>
<p>challenging as the kids get older. This is not only because homework these days tends to be interactive,</p>
<p>requiring parental participation. It gets more challenging also because, as kids enter the middle and high school</p>
<p>years, they need more and more time to talk through their days, their feelings, their concerns. Father needs to be</p>
<p>there for them, but in some ways mother needs to be there for them even more. Even when he is involved and</p>
<p>being the support he should be, she still is being asked to do an enormous amount. Oh yes—what about family</p>
<p>vacations, relationships with the in-laws, and those special times (memory-creating activities or outings) so vital</p>
<p>to the healthy upbringing of the children?</p>
<p>17 Often the phrase “good deeds” in the N.T. is a technical term meaning helping the needy.</p>
<p>18 Nothing is said about her “personal fruitfulness,” or ability to “crank her group.” Nothing is said about her</p>
<p>educational level. Nothing is said about her having ever having “been on staff.” Nor is anything said about her being</p>
<p>“sharp” or making a good impression or being attractive.</p>
<p>Is it not true that a woman’s primary responsibility (assuming she is a mother) is to create a secure spiritual</p>
<p>environment for her kids—to protect them from the world? If we honor God’s word, the children would become</p>
<p>disciples, stay disciples, and multiply themselves not only through personal outreach but also through the next</p>
<p>generation. If a woman’s highest aim is only to “crank the ministry,” however, how will her children feel? Will</p>
<p>they be inspired to imitate that example, to do great things for God? Or will they feel second class, obstacles to</p>
<p>their parents’ evangelistic success? Sadly, that question is already being answered.</p>
<p>If a mother’s most important task is to raise her children in the fear of the Lord, we believe we have some</p>
<p>rethinking to do. Restructuring will follow. Does the N.T. support the women’s role as we have defined it? We</p>
<p>do not believe so.</p>
<p>Again, though we are primarily concerned with those who lead in a “full-time” capacity, we are certainly</p>
<p>concerned with the entire “sisterhood.” Yet those whose lives are held up as an example—and which are</p>
<p>therefore in some sense normative for all the women of the church—require the greater attention at this moment.</p>
<p>Striking a balance</p>
<p>So what would the ideal staff woman’s life look like? There is no simple answer. A single sister will have much</p>
<p>more time to devote to studies and meetings than a wife with children. And yet if the single sister has not been</p>
<p>trained by an older woman in simple domestic matters, she may need to devote some time learning how to keep</p>
<p>house.</p>
<p>I (Vicki) spoke with a WML recently who does not know how to cook, despite the fact that she has been married</p>
<p>for many years and is a mother. Someone else does the cooking (hired help, not the husband). We were all</p>
<p>brought up differently. Some of us (men as well as women) still have much to learn in order for us to be able to</p>
<p>qualify biblically as elders and elders’ wives—those expected to extend hospitality, to model family for the</p>
<p>church.</p>
<p>Domestic training is best received from an older adult, one who has “been there, done that”—and possibly still</p>
<p>doing it. Titus 2 instructs the older women to devote time training the younger women. This is fairly unusual in</p>
<p>the movement. It is seldom emphasized, though much needed.</p>
<p>As the children come along, participation in staff events will be affected. Children should never be viewed as an</p>
<p>“obstacle” to ministerial effectiveness! Children are the next generation. A movement, say, of a million</p>
<p>members could easily become a movement of two million within a generation solely through the members’</p>
<p>children being reached for Christ. Have we not overextended—spent so much time reaching out to those outside</p>
<p>the church family, yet investing too little in our own sons and daughters?</p>
<p>Since we are all at different places, with different strengths and weaknesses, “one size does not fit all.” We have</p>
<p>got into trouble by tending to treating all sisters the same, ignoring the huge differences in schedule and</p>
<p>responsibilities between mothers and those who are not mothers. For years we have emphasized “imitation”—</p>
<p>yet imitation often excluding domestic qualifications. Where have we erred? We see three problem areas:</p>
<p> Encouraging (unwittingly) women to compete with men, ignoring the difference in role, domestically</p>
<p>speaking, on which the Bible is quite clear.</p>
<p> Comparing (often unfavorably) married women or mothers with single women. Sometimes their</p>
<p>differences in availability, extra commitments, and reserve energy are night-and-day!</p>
<p> Holding up as a model leaders, usually staff, who receive extra help (cleaning, chauffeuring) not</p>
<p>available to non-staff, and extra money (reimbursed restaurant meals, salary-proscribed subsidies for</p>
<p>childbearing, etc). Who can compete? People are aware of the special treatment and favoritism often</p>
<p>given leaders.</p>
<p>Striking a balance can come only when we stop comparing one sister to another in order to enforce conformity.</p>
<p>We are all different, we all have different roles to fulfill, and harm generally comes when our differences are</p>
<p>minimized. All sisters are called to be disciples of Jesus Christ; this is not under discussion. Yet how that</p>
<p>commitment expresses itself is highly variable. It varies from person to person, and it also varies from the</p>
<p>younger years to motherhood—and on to “grandmotherhood.”</p>
<p>Men the primary movers and shakers</p>
<p>If our practice is right, what biblical evidence supports it? It is pointed out that during his earthly ministry</p>
<p>certain women supported and followed Jesus (Luke 8). So did his apostles. Neither can be taken as a model for</p>
<p>how we are to live—forsaking home and community. Those were exceptional times. Certain principles still</p>
<p>apply to our time, but unthinking over-application always leads to problems. What about Priscilla? (Poor Prisca,</p>
<p>subject of countless stretched illustrations in marriage/ministry classes!) Even if Priscilla and Lydia are in the</p>
<p>Scriptures to inspire us to vibrant, outward-focused Christian living (we think they are), does this mean that</p>
<p>women without careers are second rate? Not biblically.19</p>
<p>Acts, the record of the early church in action, challenges our interpretation. What we find does not match what</p>
<p>we have proclaimed as the woman’s role. Nor do we anywhere see a “woman’s ministry leader” in action—not</p>
<p>as we have crafted the role. The other day I (Doug) was speaking with a one of our Indian evangelists, who was</p>
<p>eager to share a realization he had just come to in his personal study: In the New Testament, the men are the</p>
<p>ones who lead and make the impact, not couples.</p>
<p>This is not to say we should not aim to have spiritual couples. This is not to say we should not strive to cultivate</p>
<p>spiritual, high impact couples. It is a question of what emphasis we find in the scriptures.</p>
<p>Is it a coincidence that we read so little about women’s prominence in leadership in the N.T.? (Again, not to</p>
<p>deny that some women were powerful leaders—Romans 16 settles that one.) And the same can be said of the</p>
<p>O.T. Yes, a different covenant, as well as a different culture. But why do we think the Lord said all the males</p>
<p>had to travel to Jerusalem three times a year for the major feasts, while the women were free to remain at home</p>
<p>with their (presumably younger) kids. Is the Lord more understanding, more flexible, or more merciful than we</p>
<p>are? The Scriptures appear to indicate that he is.</p>
<p>This is certainly not to suggest a lessening of commitment on the part of our sisters—unless they have been</p>
<p>stretched beyond breaking point. But in the biblical order of things, the brunt of the pressure of leadership has</p>
<p>been designed to fall on the man. He is the stronger vessel.20</p>
<p>V. LOVE ALWAYS PROTECTS</p>
<p>“Love always protects” (1 Corinthians 13:7), said the apostle Paul. Since man is the stronger vessel, it is</p>
<p>incumbent upon him to protect his wife. (Of course, this is not to say that the wife is to expose, disregard,</p>
<p>wound, or be unkind to her husband in any way.) Even our culture recognizes this fact, as in the familiar</p>
<p>wedding vows:</p>
<p>I, ____, take you, ____,to be my wife –</p>
<p>to have and to hold</p>
<p>from this day forward;</p>
<p>for richer, for poorer,</p>
<p>in sickness and in health,</p>
<p>to love, cherish and honor,</p>
<p>till death do us part</p>
<p>19 In addition, Deborah is often held up as an example. Yes, I am aware of Barak’s “wimpiness,” his reluctance to</p>
<p>lead without Deborah’s backing, but don’t forget that he is the one mention in the Hall of Fame of Faith (Hebrews 11), not</p>
<p>Deborah.</p>
<p>20 One of the DC Regions has changed the format of its leaders’ meetings. In this particular region, the men only</p>
<p>are expected to attend the meetings. This is not to say that there will never be women’s leaders’ meetings, or that joint</p>
<p>meetings are unbiblical. But it is a practical implementation of the principles we are discussing. Will the women’s ministry</p>
<p>slow down? Not likely!</p>
<p>according to God’s holy law;</p>
<p>and this is my solemn vow.</p>
<p>Yet we men tend to do what is convenient for us. We tend to look after ourselves. We are not particularly</p>
<p>“maternal” by nature, and, sadly, forget that we are to protect our wives—physically, emotionally, and</p>
<p>spiritually. I (Doug) have sinned in this area numerous times. Let me share one example.</p>
<p>When our first child was born, the delivery was very difficult. Considering the loss of blood and tissue, it is</p>
<p>surprising that Vicki was even able to bear a second child. How did I respond at this difficult time? My aim was</p>
<p>to “get her on her feet” as quickly as possible so that she could return to the work of important the ministry as</p>
<p>soon as possible. I even left town for a couple of days shortly after the delivery. I grossly neglected my wife,</p>
<p>and failed to support and protect her as I ought to have. Vicki was surprised and (rightly) hurt that I did not</p>
<p>support her, or even protect her from the challenges she was receiving to get out of bed and “get back to work.”</p>
<p>My failure to love my wife in a Christlike way (Ephesians 5) had a negative effect on my mother-in-law. She</p>
<p>asked the leaders to let Vicki have some time off after the birth of our first child, though to no avail. This has</p>
<p>colored her feelings about the movement.</p>
<p>The world gives time off when an employee has a baby. The ICOC has no such policy.21 We have failed our</p>
<p>wives. The fact is, we have failed God, who has spoken clearly about the women’s role. But love always</p>
<p>protects.</p>
<p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>We have seen what the Bible teaches about the women’s role, and it is not the same as the teaching of our</p>
<p>movement. We have developed as a movement not simply in response to the leading of the Spirit, but under the</p>
<p>influence of the world (corporate America especially). What practical steps ought to be taken at this juncture to</p>
<p>ensure that we as a movement obey God’s Word? Here are a few recommendations on where to go from here:</p>
<p> Feelings: Ask the sisters how they are feeling. Listen to them. Brothers, as we often say, they are “our</p>
<p>biggest fans and our best critics.” This is a true saying. Brothers, are we listening to our wives?</p>
<p> Schedule: Consider exempting mothers from some of the less essential meetings. (Isn’t it interesting</p>
<p>how many high level leaders automatically exempt themselves from these meetings? And they must do</p>
<p>so, if they are to survive.) Or, apart from exceptional leadership meetings, exempt the mothers from</p>
<p>leadership meetings altogether.</p>
<p> Salary: Consider paying the husband, not the wife—returning to our previous system. Truth is, many</p>
<p>mothers feel unhealthy pressure when 50% of the salary (apart from benefits and parsonage) is legally</p>
<p>earned by them. Money tends to create obligations—and guilt. Mothering itself can be—and often</p>
<p>should be—a full-time job. Paying our wives (paying our wives “off” instead of listening to them?) may</p>
<p>be backfiring, because anything that affects the family negatively will affect the fabric of the church.</p>
<p> Responsibility level: In this time of rethinking church governance, it might be wise to scale back the</p>
<p>roles and/or responsibility levels and pressure for our sisters.</p>
<p> Discipling partners: Rethink obligations for discipling partners—especially for parents. (See the chart</p>
<p>below for a more realistic way of envisioning the realistic availability of parents for discipling times.)</p>
<p> Bible Study: Study out what the Bible says about the women’s role. In one church, the lead WML had</p>
<p>all her staff women take a few weeks to study the Pastoral Epistles and write essays on what they</p>
<p>thought the Lord was saying about the women’s role. This is the sort of exercise that will bring us to our</p>
<p>own convictions.</p>
<p>Without personal conviction it is extremely unlikely we will rethink (and escape from) our own culture.</p>
<p>As we have seen, there are many things the Bible says about the woman’s role, and there are many things the</p>
<p>Bible does not say about the woman’s role. By ignoring some precepts and inventing others, we have done our</p>
<p>sisters a grave disservice. They are paying the price, our children are suffering, and movement standards</p>
<p>21 To the best of my knowledge—though I am confident that this will change.</p>
<p>are slipping.</p>
<p>The “corporate culture” of the world, which we have bought in to, disintegrates the family; biblical culture</p>
<p>integrates it. Our movement is experiencing an alarmingly high level of disintegration. A return to spiritual</p>
<p>health goes hand-in-hand with a return to the word of God.</p>
