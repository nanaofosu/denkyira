In this chapter, we will explore the history of London, Oregon in the centuries before colonization, delving into the people, culture, and land that Indigenous people called home. We will explore the impact of the first Europeans to contact the area, as well as the unique aspects of the native culture that still exists today.</p>
<p>The area now known as London, Oregon has been home to a rich and vibrant culture since time immemorial. The original inhabitants of the area were the Native peoples, who are believed to have settled in the area over 10,000 years ago. These original inhabitants created a culture that was based on the abundant resources of the region, and established a strong sense of community and connection to the land. </p>
<p>The Native people of the area practiced a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, hunting game and foraging for plant-based food sources. This lifestyle was sustained through the use of tools and technologies such as stone tools, fire, and pottery. The people of the area also developed spiritual and cultural practices, such as storytelling and songs, that were used to pass down knowledge and traditions from one generation to the next. </p>
<p>The Native people also developed trade networks in the region, exchanging goods and services with neighboring peoples and tribes. This trade network allowed the people of London, Oregon to access resources such as food, clothing, and tools, as well as to maintain cultural and spiritual ties between different tribes. For example, the Kalapuya people, the original inhabitants of the area, traded with the Chinook and Clatsop people, who lived to the north of the region. </p>
<p>In addition to sustaining a rich culture, the Native people of London, Oregon also left a lasting impact on the physical landscape of the area.

<p>For centuries prior to European contact, the landscape of London, Oregon was explored and utilized by the local Native American population for a variety of purposes. The area was densely forested and abundant with wildlife, which provided the Native Americans with sustenance in the form of hunting and gathering. The mountains and valleys of the Cascade Range were utilized for timber, and the rivers and streams of the region provided a vital resource for transportation, communication, and fishing. In addition to providing food and shelter, the land was also used for spiritual and cultural practices, as evidenced by the presence of archaeological sites throughout the area. By exploring the land and its resources, the Native Americans of London, Oregon were able to sustain their lives and culture for generations before the arrival of Europeans.</p>

The introduction of new crops, animals, and tools had a major impact on the way of life of the native people. In addition, the European settlers brought with them a different system of beliefs and values, which sometimes clashed with the existing beliefs of the native people.</p>
<p>The new settlers also brought with them diseases that the native people had no immunity to, leading to devastating epidemics that caused many native people to die and significantly reduced the population. This, combined with the displacement of native people from their traditional lands, had a dramatic effect on the culture of the native people and led to a decline in their traditional way of life.</p>
<p>European settlers also introduced a new system of government and laws, which had a major impact on the lives of the native people. This included the establishment of reservations, which restricted the movement of the native people and imposed restrictions on their land use and access to resources. The rights of the native people were also often disregarded, leading to further social and economic decline.</p>
<p>Finally, the introduction of Christianity to the native people also had a major impact. While some native people embraced Christianity, others saw it as a foreign religion and resisted its imposition. This led to a tension between traditional cultural beliefs and the new religion, and the resulting conflict further alienated the native people from the new settlers.</p>
<p>Overall, the arrival of the European settlers in the London, Oregon area had a profound impact on the native people and their culture. The introduction of new technologies, beliefs, and laws had a dramatic effect on the way of life of the native people, leading to a decline in their traditional way of life and a greater sense of alienation from the new settlers. These impacts are still felt today, and their legacy can be seen in the current social and economic landscape of London, Oregon.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the history of London, Oregon before European contact is full of fascinating stories and insights.
